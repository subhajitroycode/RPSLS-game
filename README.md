## Code Shenanigans

### Classes

Our code's got a sense of humor too! It uses two classes: `Player` and `Game`. 

- `Player` class creates player objects with fancy attributes like name and choice.
- `Game` class manages the game's geeky logic - like figuring out who wins and making Sheldon pick random stuff.

### Switcheroo Statements

We've got this "switch" thing going on to figure out the winner in each round. It's like the game is speaking in code! It checks all the possible combos (Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock), updates scores, and makes sure nobody's cheating.

### Try-Catch-Finally Comedy

Sometimes, things get a bit wild when you make choices. The "try-catch-finally" block is our safety net. If you pick something crazy, it throws an error message but ensures that the show goes on with the "finally" block.

## Reset Button (Because We All Need a Do-Over)

If you ever need a fresh start or a do-over, hit that "Reset" button. It's like a cosmic reset - 5 new rounds, scores back to zero, and Sheldon's memory wiped clean.

Get ready for a hilarious and brainy game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock! Who will emerge victorious? Let the games begin!
